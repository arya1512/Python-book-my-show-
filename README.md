# Python-book-my-show-
This is a mini project implemented using Python data structures.
In this project, we try to simulate a program for movie ticket booking.
The user interface of this program is created using simple loops and basic concepts of data structures in Python. 
It takes various input from the users like movie name, number of tickets required, selection of seats and snacks requirement before printing the bill amount
